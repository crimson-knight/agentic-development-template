# Create A Socket

## Prerequisites

Required:
- The name of the socket
- The purpose of the WebSocket connection

Optional:
- Authentication requirements
- Channel subscriptions
- Custom connection handling logic

Review the information that you have been provided to ensure it includes all of the required information.
If there is any missing information or vague information, prompt the user for the missing information before proceeding.

## Steps

1. Create the socket file in `src/sockets` directory
   - The file should be named with the pattern `{socket_name}_socket.cr`
   - Define a struct that inherits from `Amber::WebSockets::ClientSocket`
   - Implement the required `on_connect` method
   - Add any optional methods needed (`on_disconnect`, `on_binary`, etc.)

2. Update the socket configuration in `config/initializers/socket.cr`
   - Add the socket to the WebSockets configuration
   - Provide proper routing for the socket

3. Create client-side JavaScript to connect to the socket
   - Include WebSocket connection setup
   - Implement message handling
   - Add reconnection logic if needed

For specific implementation details, see the template examples in `help/generators/templates/create_a_socket/`.

## WebSocket Configuration

1. Understanding WebSocket connection lifecycle:
   - Connection establishment
   - Message exchange
   - Connection termination
   - Error handling

2. Security considerations:
   - Authentication for socket connections
   - Authorization for specific actions
   - Protection against common WebSocket vulnerabilities

## Important Notes

1. WebSockets maintain persistent connections
   - Consider the impact on server resources
   - Implement proper connection management
   - Use appropriate scaling strategies for production

2. Cross-browser compatibility
   - Test with major browsers
   - Implement fallbacks for older browsers
   - Consider using a WebSocket library for easier compatibility
