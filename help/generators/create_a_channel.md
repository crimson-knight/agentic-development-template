# Create A Channel

## Prerequisites

Required:
- The name of the channel
- The purpose of the channel (chat, notifications, etc.)

Optional:
- Message types and formats
- Authorization requirements
- Client handling requirements

Review the information that you have been provided to ensure it includes all of the required information.
If there is any missing information or vague information, prompt the user for the missing information before proceeding.

## Steps

1. Create the channel file in `src/channels` directory
   - The file should be named with the pattern `{channel_name}_channel.cr`
   - Define a class that inherits from `Amber::WebSockets::Channel`
   - Implement the required channel methods: `handle_joined`, `handle_message`, and `handle_leave`
   - Add any custom message handling logic needed

2. Update the channel configuration in `config/initializers/socket.cr`
   - Add the channel to the WebSockets configuration
   - Configure any channel-specific settings

3. Create client-side JavaScript to interact with the channel
   - Include channel subscription logic
   - Implement message handling for different event types
   - Add message sending functionality

For specific implementation details, see the template examples in `help/generators/templates/create_a_channel/`.

## Channel vs Socket

1. Understanding the difference:
   - Sockets handle the raw WebSocket connection
   - Channels provide topic-based communication over WebSockets
   - A single Socket can support multiple Channels

2. When to use Channels:
   - For pub/sub functionality
   - When clients need to subscribe to specific topics
   - For broadcasting messages to groups of clients

## Important Notes

1. Channel authentication and authorization
   - Validate client identity in `handle_joined`
   - Implement topic-based authorization
   - Secure sensitive channels from unauthorized access

2. Message format standardization
   - Define a consistent message format
   - Include message types and timestamps
   - Structure data for easy client-side processing
