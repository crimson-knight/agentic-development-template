Language: Crystal (http://crystal-lang.org)
Web Framework: Amber (http://amberframework.org)
Frontend: Views are rendered with .ecr templates, similar to .erb in Ruby.
ORM: Jennifer (https://github.com/imdrasil/jennifer.cr)
Tasks: `Sam` is the name of the rake-like utility tool for running tasks related to the code base.

--- CLI Helper ---
When creating migrations, use this CLI command template `./sam generate:migration <underscored_migration_name_here>`
You can read about migrations and the correct methods/syntax for using this tool in the `help/jennifer_reference_docs` folder

The `amber` cli is available to you for creating scaffolding and shortcuts for other file types. This includes a generator for models, however these models are for the wrong ORM and will be invalid. If you create a scaffold or use a generator that creates a model file, you'll need to correct it using the instructions for a Jennifer model.
